#A: expr2 is protected: inf -> i is descreased by 1 of code and is increased by one of loop
#B: index is protected: inf -> n is increased by 1 each iteration and index is also increased by 1 each iteration
#C: no protected -> n is increased by 1 in code and index is maintained
#D: both index and expr2 are protected: 5 times
